# Closeout Meeting

The executive close out meeting is intended to recap the core findings from the assessment focusing on key strengths and optimization opportunities. It is important to include IT decision makers in this meeting so they gain awareness of improvement recommendations and how Microsoft can help, which they can use to make resourcing and investment decisions on what steps will be taken to execute on the recommendations.

# Deliverables

At the end of the engagement, Microsoft Services will provide a set of reporting and dashboard deliverables for the customer to use as references to execute on the improvement recommendations and for internal reporting purposes.
